# Intro:
# Nailing down the most beautiful places in Iceland is no easy feat—practically every square inch of the country is
# downright stunning. Though it once played second fiddle to Nordic neighbors Sweden and Norway, Iceland has quietly
# come into the spotlight to show the world what it's been missing all these years: expansive underground ice caves,
# towering volcanoes, thermal baths, and landscapes so convincingly lunar that astronauts once trained there.
# There is no shortage of beautiful vistas in the country, but these are some of the very best.

# Blue Lagoon
# Grindavík’s Blue Lagoon (about a 50-minute drive from the capital) is otherworldly in appearance—black lava
# rock punctuated with milky blue waters, and steam billowing like clouds. But the visual appeal is only part
# of the experience. A soak in the 100-degree waters (which come from the output of a nearby geothermal plant)
# is a spa-like experience all its own, with silica mud masks and mineral salts ensuring your skin will look and
# feel better than it did when you got there.

# Hótel Buđir
# It may seem strange to include a hotel in a list of so many natural wonders, but that's a testament to just how
# beautiful Hótel Buđir really is. Its magical setting on a remote peninsula two hours from Reykjavik features the
# sea behind it, lava fields in front of it, and a tiny black church beside it. The hotel itself is rustic-chic,
# and even offers wake-up calls if and when the Northern Lights make a late-night appearance.

# Hvítserkur
# Often referred to as the “troll of northwest Iceland,” Hvítserkur rises 49 feet from from Húnaflói Bay like some
# sort of mythical beast. The rock—best viewed from Iceland's Arctic Coast Way—often looks like it's moving due to
# the birds that love to perch atop it, making the formation feel more like a living creature.

# Landmannalaugar
# Located in Iceland's southern Highlands, the area of Landmannalaugar has some of the most colorful landscapes
# in the country thanks to its high geothermal activity. It's an extremely popular hiking area during the summer
# months, where lucky visitors can be surrounded by a veritable kaleidoscope of greens, oranges, reds, blacks, browns,
# and more.

# Mount Mælifell
# A volcanic cone of ashes and lava rock, the 2595-foot Mælifell sits on the edge of the Mýrdalsjökull glacier and
# covered in grimmia, a moss that changes color depending on the soil’s humidity. You can drive past the volcano
# during the summer months, or see it along the Laugavegur Route: the most popular multi-day hiking route in Iceland.

# Reynisfjara
# Just a 20-minute drive from Vik, in southern Iceland, jet-black sand and spectacularly shaped basalt columns make
# Reynisfjara one of the most impressive sites in the country. Spend a foggy afternoon strolling along the rugged
# coast (just strolling—these waters are definitely not made for swimming) and photographing the moon-like rock
# formations, deep caves, and towering cliff faces.

# Seljalandsfoss
# Seljalandsfoss might be a bit of a drive from Reykjavik—about an hour and 45 minutes, to be exact—but it’s worth
# the trip to see this impressive south-coast waterfall thunder down from a 200-foot drop. The best thing about
# these particular falls is that you can actually walk behind them, pretending you're living in a fairy tale for
# a couple of minutes.

# Skógafoss
# An easy stop off Route 1 (aka the Ring Road), Skógafoss is one of the most beautiful places in Iceland—and in a land
# of so many waterfalls, that's definitely saying something. The 197-foot cascade crashes onto black sand, and you can
# walk right up to the bottom if you're willing to get drenched. Worth it for the double rainbow viewings, we say.

# Strokkur
# The Haukadalur valley is a popular stop along Iceland's popular “Golden Circle” sightseeing route thanks to its
# abundance of impressive geysers. The most visited active geyser in the Geysir Geothermal Area
# (and the entire country), Strokkur erupts upwards of 65 feet, and every five to ten minutes.

# Thingvellir National Park
# Thingvellir is one of Iceland’s two UNESCO sites and one of the most consistently popular tourist destinations
# in the country. You could spend hours hiking and horseback riding through the national park on your own, but we
# suggest booking a snorkeling or diving excursion to swim the Silfra fissure—a slowly widening rift between
# the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates.

# Vatnajökull
# Home to one of the largest glaciers in the world, Vatnajökull National Park is one of our favorite places to
# explore ice caves. But there's more than just frozen ice rivers to see at Vatnajökull, which covers much of
# Iceland's eastern half. It holds two of the island's most active volcanoes, herds of reindeer around Mt. Snæfell,
# and a number of breathtaking waterfalls, including Svartifoss, Dettifoss, and Selfoss.

# Westfjords
# Only about 14 percent of visitors to Iceland ever get to this large peninsula in the northwestern part of the country,
# which makes it a fitting destination for those looking to escape the (relative) hustle and bustle of Reykjavik.
# Home to some of Iceland's most dramatic landscapes, diverse wildlife, and charming beach towns
# (like Breiðavík, pictured), the Westfjords are more inaccessible than other parts of the country, but are well worth
# the trip.
