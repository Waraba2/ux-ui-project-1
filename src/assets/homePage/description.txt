# Intro:
# Nailing down the most beautiful places in Iceland is no easy feat—practically every square inch of the country is
# downright stunning. Though it once played second fiddle to Nordic neighbors Sweden and Norway, Iceland has quietly
# come into the spotlight to show the world what it's been missing all these years: expansive underground ice caves,
# towering volcanoes, thermal baths, and landscapes so convincingly lunar that astronauts once trained there.
# There is no shortage of beautiful vistas in the country, but these are some of the very best.




# Strokkur
# The Haukadalur valley is a popular stop along Iceland's popular “Golden Circle” sightseeing route thanks to its
# abundance of impressive geysers. The most visited active geyser in the Geysir Geothermal Area
# (and the entire country), Strokkur erupts upwards of 65 feet, and every five to ten minutes.

# Thingvellir National Park
# Thingvellir is one of Iceland’s two UNESCO sites and one of the most consistently popular tourist destinations
# in the country. You could spend hours hiking and horseback riding through the national park on your own, but we
# suggest booking a snorkeling or diving excursion to swim the Silfra fissure—a slowly widening rift between
# the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates.

# Vatnajökull
# Home to one of the largest glaciers in the world, Vatnajökull National Park is one of our favorite places to
# explore ice caves. But there's more than just frozen ice rivers to see at Vatnajökull, which covers much of
# Iceland's eastern half. It holds two of the island's most active volcanoes, herds of reindeer around Mt. Snæfell,
# and a number of breathtaking waterfalls, including Svartifoss, Dettifoss, and Selfoss.

# Westfjords
# Only about 14 percent of visitors to Iceland ever get to this large peninsula in the northwestern part of the country,
# which makes it a fitting destination for those looking to escape the (relative) hustle and bustle of Reykjavik.
# Home to some of Iceland's most dramatic landscapes, diverse wildlife, and charming beach towns
# (like Breiðavík, pictured), the Westfjords are more inaccessible than other parts of the country, but are well worth
# the trip.
